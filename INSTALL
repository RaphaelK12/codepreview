To install the preview handler simply copy the DLL to some folder from where code can be executed (like "C:\Program Files (x86)\CodePreview").

Open a terminal with administrative rights and navigate to the folder with the DLL. Install the DLL by executing "regsvr32 /i [DLL]". You should get a message telling you that the DLL was successfully installed. You can instantly use the preview handler, no restart needed.

To uninstall do the same as above but with the command "regsvr32 /u [DLL]".
